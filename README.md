# About 
This script uses an Open-Source LLM with Groq to fix typos.

# Prerequisites
- Groq API Key

# How to use
By default the script uses LLama 3 8b but this can be changed by changing the "model" parameter in main.py. 

The default keys are:
- F9 for fixing the current line.
- F10 for fixing selected text.
- ESC to exit.
